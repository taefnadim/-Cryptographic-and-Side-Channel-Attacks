# -Cryptographic-and-Side-Channel-Attacks
Demonstrated cryptographic tasks like key generation, encryption, and X.509 verification with OpenSSL on Linux VM. Also implemented the Spectre attack, a side-channel exploit using speculative execution and cache timing to access restricted memory, highlighting data exposure risks through speculative CPU operations.
